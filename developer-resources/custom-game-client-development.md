# Custom Game Client Development

By forking the [React/WebGL client frontend](https://github.com/darkforest-eth/client) and running one yarn command you'll be running a webpack local dev client against mainnet. This allows you to edit the client to your liking customizing any part of the game and the license even allows you to fork to your own open source version and publish to IPFS or a static site host like netlify to share with your guild or friends.

Also with the local client running you can develop plugins in your usual text editor. The webpack loader will watch the local_plugins directory for changes and reload your plugin automatically.
