# 3rd-party Contract Development

If you're interested in Ethereum smart contract development and Hardhat tooling we release all [smart contract source code and scripts](https://github.com/darkforest-eth/eth) used in developing and maintaining the game

But thats not all. With that knowledge you should be able to write contracts that interact with the mainnet Dark Forest universe, no permission needed. See the [Sophon Reveal Marketplace](https://github.com/projectsophon/df-play-to-earn) example for a contract that lets users sell their daily reveal to the first bidder.
